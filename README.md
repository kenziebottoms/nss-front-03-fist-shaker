# Shake your fist at the sky

Practice jQuery and Promises and optionally Handlebars
 
- [x] Accept two dates from the user (year, month, day) as a search parameter.
- [x] Use the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS) to make an Ajax call that will gather data about what objects will be close to our planet in the timeframe specified by the user's dates.
- [x] Using the data you get back from NASA (promises!), use [FOAAS](http://www.foaas.com/) to tell three of those asteroids to fuck off, by name.
    - [x] You can use whichever of the foaas message types you like.
- [x] Print these sky-fist-shaking statements to the DOM.
 
### Bonus: 

- [ ] Only tell those asteroids that are "potentially hazardous" to fuck off.
- [ ] Use different messages from foaas for the different asteroids.
- [ ] Use Handlebars to print your three messages to the DOM.
